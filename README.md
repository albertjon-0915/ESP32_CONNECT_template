# ESP32_CONNECT_template
1. This is a custom template to access a portal and connect ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network through a locally hosted website. This is to dynamically change the network we could connect without manually coding it every time.
2. I also included an simple mobile app to enable provisioning of wifi to esp32 via EspTouch protocols based on dart/flutter package of esp_smartconfig

### Still work in progress...
